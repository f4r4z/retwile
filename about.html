		 <p id="content">Ashkan Amiri (better known by his stage name: Retwile) is an Iranian rapper based in Kerman who started his professional career in 2015.</br>
Initially, Ashkan met YungFvce through mutual friends and this duo created a few tracks in the genre of rap, but never got to release them. Meeting
Arvin Arasteh in 2016 had a huge impact on Ashkan’s career because Ashkan met Mohammad Master and created a few music projects in newer styles. </br>
At the same time in 2016, Ashkan met Faraz Heravi who had similar style and taste in music. This friendship created new opportunities for Ashkan.
 Their first collaboration was in the same year and another one the year after, but until 2020, they did not collaborate in music. Meanwhile Ashkan met
  Shoki (producer) and tried to produce a few tracks but it was not successful. </br>
Towards the end of 2017 and after Ashkan’s failure in his projects, he decided to quit music, but a few months after meeting Arman Vino through
Faraz Heravi, he was able to make a comeback to creating music. </br>
Although Ashkan did not have any works in 2019, he produced many music projects including his collaboration with YungFvce, Vino, and Heravi.
In 2020 Ashkan released his first official track on international platforms. </br>
Currently Ashkan is working in new music projects.
